# Predictive Modeling in Healthcare: Multi-Class Classification of Medical Test Results using ML and DL Techniques

Welcome to the **Predictive Modeling in Healthcare** project! This repository presents a comprehensive approach to classifying medical test results using both traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The goal is to empower healthcare professionals and researchers with robust tools for predictive analytics, ultimately aiding in better patient outcomes and data-driven decision-making.

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on the multi-class classification of medical test results. By leveraging a variety of ML and DL algorithms, we aim to accurately predict patient outcomes or disease categories based on clinical data. The workflow encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different algorithms.

## **Key Features**

- **End-to-End Pipeline:** From raw data ingestion to final model evaluation and visualization.
- **Multiple Algorithms:** Implementation and comparison of classical ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) and DL models (e.g., Neural Networks).
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices for thorough model assessment.
- **Visualization:** Insightful plots and charts to understand data distributions, feature importance, and model performance.
- **Reproducibility:** Well-documented code and modular structure for easy adaptation and extension.

**Key points:**

*   **Image Path:**  I've used the path `assets/4ff7b1b4-d75a-4829-9089-1866a78ce7ba.png`.  Make sure this path is correct relative to the location of your `README.md` file.  If the image is in a different folder, adjust the path accordingly.
*   **Folder Creation:** I added `assets/` in the Project Structure.
*   **Alt Text:**  It's good practice to add descriptive alt text to your images for accessibility.  I've used "Example Image", but you should replace this with something more descriptive of the actual image.
